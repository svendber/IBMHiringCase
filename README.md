## Choice of technology
I've chosen PHP for it's flexibility and scalability, framework and CMS such as 'Laravel' (wasn't used in this project) and it's vast amount of Libary support. I wanted to go for a full-stack development for the Virtual white board assignement, PHP is excellent to customize and fast change direcetions because of it's scalability. PHP can excecute scripts which is why I implemented Mimesis, a fake data generator, which I wanted to be a bigger part of the Virtual Boards to create content.
